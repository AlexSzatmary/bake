0.1.0 No new files needed!

Things that this breaks:

* bake.cfg files have a new format. The one in example/cookie is a good
  example. This is described in the README.

* Custom cmdline.py bake front-ends break because of the substantial changes to
  the api. The cmdline.py in example/poisson/myBake is a good example. This is
  a good change; the new cmdline.py in this example is about 10 lines shorter
  than in the 0.0.0 release.

New features:

* No files are needed to make a project use bake. Just do `mkdir batch`;
  everything else can be specified with command line flags. Currently, the
  minimal use for bake is, 1. install bake, 2. in any directory, do

    mkdir batch; bake -l -o '@foo@;bar;baz'

  outputting,

    foobar
    foobaz

* bp files now can have include statements. If a bp file has the line,
  `include(foo.bp)`, Bake replaces that line with the text of `foo.bp`. This is
  most useful for having a default configuration, and then bp files that refine
  that for specific cases. One can even have hierarchies with a specific case
  file including parameters for a project, which includes default values for
  the whole code.

* Automatic testing. Both unit tests and end-to-end tests are set up in an
  organized way. These should make it clear that Bake continues to behave as
  expected as new features are added. Some of this was in the 0.0.0 release,
  but this is now systematized. See testing.txt for information.

0.0.2 Bugfix: Cookie test code
0.0.1 Bugfix: Restore \n removal from end of bp line
