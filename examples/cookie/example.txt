cookie is a super easy example of what bake is useful for.

cookie.txt is an outline for a recipe for cookies. When, in the cookie
directory, you do:
bake bp/plain
bake takes cookie.txt, modifies it according to bp, and puts it in
batch/cookie-decoration-none/cookie.txt

cookie.txt has a line with a tag in it, the last line:
decoration: @decoration@
Here, @decoration@ is a tag. By default, tags are enclosed in matched @ signs.
