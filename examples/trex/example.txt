This is not a great example, and is more of a bizarre test case. In this
Dinosaur Comic,

    http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2025

T-Rex has a generic sales pitch; this code generates each one of these
pitches. Be careful, there are a lot of them! This is an example of how bake
can be used with no setup except for doing `mkdir batch`. The following command
generates 23 T-Rex sales pitches!

    $ bake -l -f trex.bp -s 121-144 -e 'cat trex.txt' -o '@possessive@;your' \
          -o '@desire@;love' -o '@location@;beachhouse' \
	  -o '@adjective1@;amazing' -b trex.txt

(If you haven't installed bake, you can do `../../bake/cmdline.py` instead of
`bake` in this example.)
