The meanings of each of the parameters in the batch parameter files
$td$ Timestep (program units)

$umean$ Velocity at the center of the flow field (cm/s)
This should be expressed as a Fortran array:
(/u, v, w/)

$bfs1$
$bfs2$
$bfs3$
This is the E matrix in u = E*x + b
bfsi is the ith row of E, expressed as a Fortran array 
(/bfsi1, bfsi2, bfsi3/)

$ncap$
The number of capsules in the flow

$rad$
The radii of the capsules in the flow, expressed as a Fortran array

$xc_cap$
$yc_cap$
$zc_cap$
The (x, y, z) coordinates of the center of each capsule, expressed as
a Fortran array 

$fineness$
The level of refinement of each capsule. This should be a Fortran
array of integers, ranging from 2 to something like 7 or 8. 5 is a
sensible value, giving 10242 nodes and 20480 elements.

$npls$
The number of planes being modeled.

$pl_n1$
The number of nodes in the 1-direction on the plane (x, without rotation)

$pl_n2$
The number of nodes in the 2-direction on the plane (z, without rotation)

$recty$
The height (y-coordinate) of the rectangle

$planey$
The height (y-coordinate) of the plane (obsolescent)

$lngx$
The log_2 of the number of fluid nodes in the x-direction

$FVS$
1 if FVS is to be used, 0 otherwise. (Use 1.)

$mix$
Sets a variable, mix, that is used in the mixed flow study. Useless, otherwise.

$smalldumpint$
The interval on which certain relatively small datafiles are output,
measured in an integer number of timesteps.

$bigdumpint$
The interval on which certain relatively large datafiles are output,
measured in an integer number of timesteps.

$nu$
Kinematic viscosity

$lcube$
Length of one side of the fluid domain (cm)

$rho$
Density of the fluid, in g/cm^3

$dpdz$
The pressure gradient, program units for pressure.

$Eh$
The stiffness of the membrane, in dyn/cm

$radx$
A characteristic radius in the problem

$mu$
Dynamic viscosity

$nend$
Number of timesteps till end of simulation

$nstep$
Number of timesteps until stopping the simulation for a break.

$nm$
$np$
$omega_zero$
$epsilono$
$lambda$
$index$
$opticalPower$
$lightSpeed$
$numberOfMaxReflections$
All of these parameters are from the optics code. I don't know how the
optics code works, and these don't matter if the optics code is used.

$optical$
1 if optical physics are used, 0 otherwise

In addition, there are tokens used in calculating values for other
tokens, but that aren't mentioned in the code. This is fine. Here are
some common examples:       	     

$t_end$
Ending timestep

$capillary_no$
Capillary number

$gamma_dot$
Shear rate

$gapratio$
When a capsule is near a wall, this is the ratio of the distance from
the wall to the nearest point on the capsule to the radius of the capsule.

$b$
This is $lcube$/$radx$, useful in taking care of the domain dependence

$gamma_dot_p$
The shear rate in program units
