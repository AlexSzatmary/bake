The best way to learn Subversion is to use it, and the best
information you can get on it is from its built-in help system:
svn help
You can get help on a given command by typing:
svn help command
You can get more information on Subversion on the Internet at:

Commands you'll use a lot are:
checkout
Use:
svn co
svn+ssh://user@eggletonlinux.meng.umbc.edu:/scratch/linux1/svn_repo...
/trunk/immersed_boundary/cell [name]
checks out the cell project to the directory named name. (The square
brackets indicate that name is optional; if you don't type one in, the
checked-out code is saved as cell.)

check in
Use:
svn ci [files]
Submits your changed files to the repository. If you type in specific
files, only the ones you name will be committed.

status
Use:
svn status [files]
Tells you which files are going to be changed in the repository when
you checkin. You can optionally name specific files for this
purpose. Use the -u flag:
svn status -u
to see, in addition to this, which files need to be updated.

update
Use:
svn update
Updates your files, if they've changed in the repository since they
were last checked out/updated.

diff
Use:
svn diff [files]
Shows the modifications you made to the code since the last checkout/update.
